apollo510 SBL Updates

SBL v1.20:
- The OTA update file 'sbl_ota_v1p20.bin' is the current SBL at the time of the RTM release.
  its OTA file is included for testing and verification of the SBL OTA update process. 

SBL v1.23:
- Earlier versions of SBL (SBL v1.20 and prior) would not de-configure SWO pin correctly if an alternate SWO pin was used.
  - This only occurred when InfoC was configured to use a pin other than the default pin 28.
- Fixed an issue with the last byte of a wired reset ACK being chopped or lost.
- Fixed an issue with the OEM Key revoke operation.
- The memory sizes reported are now based on the SKU register.
