 NemaGFX Earth-from-Space Rendering Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates 3D rendering of the Earth as
 seen from space, using NemaGFX GPU acceleration. The application features
 real-time zoom and pan effects controlled by multi-touch input, providing
 an interactive visualization of the planet. The example is designed to
 showcase the GPU's ability to handle complex image transformations and
 user interaction.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Earth from Space Rendering: Displays a realistic view of the Earth
    using high-resolution textures and GPU-accelerated rendering

 2. Multi-Touch Zoom: Supports pinch-to-zoom and pan gestures for
    interactive exploration (requires display card rev2)

 3. Real-Time Animation: Smoothly updates the view in response to user
    input for an immersive experience

 4. Hardware Acceleration: Utilizes NemaGFX GPU for efficient image
    transformations and rendering

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display card rev2 with multi-touch firmware
 - Sufficient memory for high-resolution textures and frame buffers

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically renders the Earth from space. Use multi-touch
 gestures to zoom and pan the view. Ensure the display card firmware supports
 multi-touch; if not, run nemagfx_tp_firmware_update to upgrade.

 NOTE: Multi-touch is required for full functionality. Confirm display card
       firmware is up to date for proper demonstration.
