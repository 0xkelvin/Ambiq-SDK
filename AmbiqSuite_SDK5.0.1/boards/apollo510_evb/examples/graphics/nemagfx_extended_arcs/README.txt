============
 NemaGFX Extended Arc Rendering Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates arc rendering capabilities
 using the NemaGFX_Extended library. The application showcases round line
 end arcs with full alpha blending, dynamically animating the start and end
 angles to create smooth, visually appealing transitions. The example also
 demonstrates compositing with alpha channel images and blending factors.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Extended Arc Rendering: Draws arcs with round line ends and
    anti-aliasing for graphics

 2. Alpha Blending: Demonstrates full alpha blending with RGBA images
    and arc primitives

 3. Dynamic Animation: Continuously animates arc angles for real-time
    visual effects

 4. Image Compositing: Overlays alpha channel images with blending
    options for complex UI effects

 5. Hardware Acceleration: Utilizes NemaGFX GPU for efficient arc
    and image rendering

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel for arc visualization
 - Sufficient memory for frame buffers and RGBA images

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically renders animated arcs with round ends and
 overlays an alpha channel image. The effect demonstrates the GPU's
 ability to produce anti-aliased primitives and blended
 images for modern graphical interfaces.

 NOTE: Apollo510 devices use the MIPI DSI interface by default
