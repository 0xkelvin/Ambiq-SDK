============
 NemaGFX Vector Graphics Shape Rendering Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates the shape rendering
 capabilities of NemaGFX Vector Graphics library. The application showcases
 various predefined shapes with different paint settings and transformations.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Basic Shapes: Demonstrates fundamental geometric shapes including
    circles, ellipses, rectangles, and lines

 2. Shapes: Shows complex shapes like rings and rounded
    rectangles with configurable parameters

 3. Paint Integration: Combines shape rendering with various paint
    features including gradients, patterns, and color fills

 4. Vector Graphics: Uses hardware-accelerated vector graphics for
    scalable shape rendering

 5. High Performance Mode: Supports high-performance mode for optimal
    rendering performance on compatible hardware

Section: Available Shapes
=========================

 - Circle: Perfect circular shapes with configurable radius
 - Ellipse: Elliptical shapes with independent x/y scaling
 - Ring: Circular rings with inner and outer radius
 - Line: Straight line segments with configurable thickness
 - Rectangle: Rectangular shapes with sharp corners
 - Rounded Rectangle: Rectangles with rounded corners

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel for shape visualization
 - Sufficient memory for vector graphics operations

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically renders various shapes with different
 paint settings and displays them on screen. Each shape demonstrates
 different vector graphics capabilities and rendering techniques.

 NOTE: Shapes are rendered using hardware acceleration for optimal performance
