Description:
============
 NemaGFX Vector Graphics Circular Bar Rendering Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates the rendering of a circular bar (progress or gauge)
 using NemaGFX Vector Graphics. The application draws a circular bar image, as seen in
 the watch_face.png resource, and showcases smooth, hardware-accelerated vector graphics.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Circular Bar Rendering: Draws a circular progress or gauge bar with configurable
    parameters for angle, thickness, and color.

 2. Vector Graphics: Uses hardware-accelerated vector graphics for smooth, scalable
    rendering without pixelation.

 3. High Performance Mode: Supports high-performance mode for optimal rendering
    on compatible hardware.

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel for circular bar visualization
 - Sufficient memory for vector graphics operations

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically renders a circular bar on the display. The bar can be
 customized in the source code for different angles, thicknesses, and colors.

 NOTE: Rendering uses hardware acceleration for optimal performance.
