Description:
============
 LVGL Watch Demo with GPU Acceleration Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates LVGL watch face rendering with GPU
 acceleration using NemaGFX. The application showcases texture management
 by copying textures from MRAM to PSRAM during initialization, providing
 a simplified but effective approach to texture handling. The example
 demonstrates how to leverage GPU acceleration for improved performance
 while maintaining the flexibility of LVGL for UI development.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. GPU Acceleration: Utilizes NemaGFX GPU for improved rendering
    performance and visual quality

 2. Texture Management: Demonstrates efficient texture copying from
    MRAM to PSRAM for optimal memory usage

 3. LVGL Integration: Showcases LVGL library with GPU acceleration
    for modern UI development

 4. PSRAM Support: Utilizes external PSRAM for large texture assets
    and frame buffers

 5. Simplified Approach: Provides a straightforward implementation
    suitable for rapid prototyping and development

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel for watch demo visualization
 - PSRAM for texture storage and frame buffers

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically displays a watch demo with GPU-accelerated
 rendering. The example demonstrates efficient texture management and
 GPU integration for enhanced graphics performance.

 NOTE: Textures are copied from MRAM to PSRAM during initialization
