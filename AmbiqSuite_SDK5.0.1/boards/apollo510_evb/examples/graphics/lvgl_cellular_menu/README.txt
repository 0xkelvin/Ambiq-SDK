Description:
============
 LVGL Cellular Menu with Touch Support Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates LVGL cellular menu interface with
 extensive icon assets loaded from MRAM into PSRAM. During animation,
 the GPU fetches data from PSRAM, significantly reducing SSRAM usage
 while maintaining high performance. The application includes touch
 support for interactive menu navigation and displays PFS (Performance)
 metrics at the bottom of the screen.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Cellular Menu Interface: Implements a modern cellular-style
    menu with smooth animations and transitions

 2. Icon Asset Management: Loads large icon assets from MRAM to
    PSRAM for efficient memory usage

 3. Touch Support: Provides full touch interaction for menu
    navigation and selection

 4. Performance Monitoring: Displays PFS (Performance) metrics
    for real-time performance analysis

 5. GPU Acceleration: Utilizes GPU for efficient icon rendering
    and animation processing

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Touch-enabled display panel
 - PSRAM for large icon assets

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically displays a cellular menu with touch
 support. Performance metrics are shown at the bottom of the screen.
 Use touch gestures to navigate the menu interface.

 NOTE: Icon assets are loaded from MRAM to PSRAM for memory efficiency
