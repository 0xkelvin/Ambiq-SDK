============
 NemaGFX Color Gradient Rendering Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates smooth color gradient rendering using
 NemaGFX GPU acceleration. The application fills a grid of rectangles with
 position-dependent color gradients, producing visually appealing smooth
 transitions between colors. This technique is widely used for backgrounds,
 UI elements, and visual effects in modern graphical applications.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Gradient Rendering: Fills regions with continuous color transitions
    using position-dependent color interpolation

 2. Grid Demonstration: Renders a grid of rectangles, each with unique
    gradient effects to showcase versatility

 3. Hardware Acceleration: Utilizes NemaGFX GPU for efficient gradient
    calculations and rendering

 4. Customizable Colors: Supports different color schemes and gradient
    directions for flexible UI design

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel for gradient visualization
 - Sufficient memory for frame buffers

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically renders a grid of rectangles with smooth
 color gradients. The effect demonstrates the GPU's ability to produce
 1MHzvisual transitions for backgrounds and UI elements.

 NOTE: Debug output is available via ITM when AM_DEBUG_PRINTF is enabled
