Description:
============
 NemaGFX Vector Graphics Masking and Layer Effects Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates masking features in NemaGFX
 Vector Graphics with scaling and rotation effects. The application uses
 multiple DC layers with different global alpha settings to create fading
 effects commonly used in background task switching scenarios.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Masking: Demonstrates masking techniques
    for complex clipping and overlay operations

 2. Scaling Effects: Shows masking in combination with scaling
    transformations for dynamic visual effects

 3. Rotation Effects: Implements masking with rotation transformations
    for complex geometric clipping

 4. Multi-Layer Rendering: Uses multiple DC layers with different
    alpha settings for depth and transparency effects

 5. Fading Effects: Creates smooth transitions and fading effects
    suitable for UI transitions and task switching

Section: Technical Details
==========================

 - Uses PSRAM for large graphics buffers and masking operations
 - Implements MSPI configuration for high-speed memory access
 - Supports SEGGER SystemView tracing for performance analysis
 - Demonstrates hardware-accelerated masking operations

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - PSRAM for graphics buffer management
 - Display panel for masking effect visualization
 - Sufficient memory for multi-layer operations

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically demonstrates masking effects with scaling
 and rotation transformations. The multi-layer approach creates smooth
 fading transitions suitable for modern UI applications.

 NOTE: Masking operations require significant memory bandwidth for optimal performance
