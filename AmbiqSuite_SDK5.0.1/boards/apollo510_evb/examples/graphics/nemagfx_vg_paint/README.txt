============
 NemaGFX Vector Graphics Paint and Fill Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates the paint and fill
 capabilities of NemaGFX Vector Graphics library. The application showcases
 various paint types and fill patterns for creating rich visual effects.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Linear Gradient Paint: Demonstrates smooth color transitions
    along linear paths with configurable color stops

 2. Texture Paint: Shows texture-based filling with image patterns
    and repeat modes for complex visual effects

 3. Conic Gradient Paint: Implements radial color transitions
    from center outward with angular color distribution

 4. Color Fill Paint: Basic solid color filling with alpha
    transparency support

 5. Outline-Only Paint: Demonstrates stroke rendering without
    fill for wireframe and line-based graphics

Section: Paint Types
====================

 - Linear Gradient: Smooth color transitions along straight lines
 - Texture Paint: Image-based pattern filling with tiling options
 - Conic Gradient: Radial color transitions with angular control
 - Solid Color: Uniform color filling with transparency
 - Outline: Stroke-only rendering for wireframe effects

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel for paint effect visualization
 - Sufficient memory for texture and gradient operations

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically demonstrates various paint types on
 different shapes and objects. Each paint type shows different
 visual effects and rendering capabilities.

 NOTE: Paint operations use hardware acceleration for optimal performance
