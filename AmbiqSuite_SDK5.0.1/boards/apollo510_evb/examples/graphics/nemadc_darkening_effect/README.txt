============
 NemaDC Darkening Effect and Pull-Down Menu Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates UI effects using NemaDC
 display controller, including pull-down menu animations and darkening
 effects. The application showcases multi-layer blending techniques
 to create smooth transitions and visual overlays commonly used in
 modern graphical user interfaces. The effects are compatible with
 SPI4, DSPI, QSPI, and DSI interfaces.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Pull-Down Menu: Implements smooth pull-down menu animations
    with proper layer positioning and transitions

 2. Darkening Effect: Creates overlay darkening effects using
    global alpha blending for UI emphasis

 3. Multi-Layer Blending: Demonstrates complex layer interactions
    with different blend modes and alpha values

 4. Smooth Animations: Implements continuous animation with
    configurable step sizes for fluid transitions

 5. Multi-Interface Support: Works with SPI4, DSPI, QSPI, and
    DSI interfaces for flexible deployment

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel supporting multi-layer rendering
 - Sufficient memory for multiple frame buffers

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically demonstrates pull-down menu and darkening
 effects using multi-layer blending.

 NOTE: Layer size must be a multiple of 4 for Apollo5 compatibility
