Description:
============
 LVGL Watch Face with CPU-Only Rendering Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics
 Library) watch face rendering using CPU-only graphics processing.
 The application showcases how to create watch face
 interfaces without GPU acceleration, optimizing for low-power
 operation and battery life. The example includes PSRAM support
 for large graphics assets and demonstrates efficient CPU-based
 rendering techniques.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Watch Face Design: Implements a complete digital watch face
    with time display, date, and visual elements

 2. CPU-Only Rendering: Demonstrates efficient graphics rendering
    without GPU acceleration for power optimization

 3. Low Power Operation: Optimized for battery-powered devices
    with minimal power consumption

 4. PSRAM Integration: Utilizes external PSRAM for large
    graphics assets and frame buffers

 5. LVGL Integration: Showcases LVGL library integration for
    modern UI development

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel for watch face visualization
 - Optional: PSRAM for large graphics assets

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically displays a watch face with time and
 date information.

 NOTE: CPU-only rendering is optimized for low power consumption
