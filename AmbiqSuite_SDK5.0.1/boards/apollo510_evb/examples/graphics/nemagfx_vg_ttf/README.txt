 NemaGFX Vector Graphics True Type Font Rendering Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates True Type Font (TTF) rendering
 capabilities using NemaVG vector graphics library. The example showcases
 1MHztext rendering with various alignment options and font features.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. True Type Font Support: Renders TTF fonts with full Unicode support
    and scalable vector graphics for crisp text at any resolution

 2. Text Alignment Options: Demonstrates various text alignment features
    including left, center, right, and justified text positioning

 3. Vector Graphics Rendering: Uses NemaVG for hardware-accelerated
    vector graphics rendering with optimal performance

 4. Multi-threaded Architecture: Implements FreeRTOS tasks for rendering
    and display management with proper synchronization

 5. High Performance Mode: Supports high-performance mode for optimal
    rendering performance on compatible hardware

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel for text rendering visualization
 - Sufficient memory for font caching and rendering

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically loads TTF fonts and displays various text
 samples with different alignment options. Text rendering is performed
 using vector graphics for optimal quality at all resolutions.

 NOTE: This example requires TTF font files to be properly configured
