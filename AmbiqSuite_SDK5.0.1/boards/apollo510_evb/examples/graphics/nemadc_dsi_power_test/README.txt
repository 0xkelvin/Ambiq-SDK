 NemaDC DSI Power Management and ULPS Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates power management techniques
 for MIPI DSI displays using NemaDC. The application showcases ULPS
 (Ultra-Low Power State) entry and exit sequences, display panel
 power control, and power optimization strategies for
 battery-powered systems.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. ULPS Power Management: Implements Ultra-Low Power State
    entry and exit for significant power savings

 2. Display Panel Control: Demonstrates proper display panel
    power-up and power-down sequences

 3. Dynamic Power Control: Demonstrates power management
    for energy-efficient display operation

 4. Runtime Power State Transitions: Implements runtime power state
    transitions for optimal energy efficiency

 5. Power Measurement: Includes measurement points for power
    consumption analysis and optimization

Section: Power Modes
====================

 - Normal Mode: Standard display operation with full functionality
 - ULPS Mode: Ultra-Low Power State for maximum power savings
 - Sleep Mode: Display panel sleep for intermediate power savings

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - MIPI DSI-compatible display panel
 - Power measurement equipment for optimization analysis

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically demonstrates power management sequences
 including ULPS entry/exit and display panel control. Use the provided
 measurement points to analyze power consumption and optimize for
 battery life.

 NOTE: Power measurement macros are available for detailed analysis
