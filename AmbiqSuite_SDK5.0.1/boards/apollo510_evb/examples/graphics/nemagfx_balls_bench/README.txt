============
 NemaGFX Animated Balls Performance Benchmark Example




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates animated balls with alpha blending
 for performance benchmarking using NemaGFX GPU acceleration. The
 application creates multiple randomly positioned balls that bounce
 around the screen with realistic physics, showcasing the GPU's ability
 to handle real-time animation and blending operations efficiently.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Animated Balls: Renders multiple circles with independent
    movement, speed, and direction for dynamic visual effects

 2. Alpha Blending: Each ball uses alpha blending for smooth
    visual integration and transparency effects

 3. Physics Simulation: Implements realistic bouncing behavior
    when balls hit screen boundaries

 4. Performance Benchmarking: Measures and reports FPS and
    rendering performance metrics

 5. Configurable Ball Count: Adjust MAX_CIRCLE_NUM to test
    different performance scenarios

Section: Hardware Requirements
==============================

 - Compatible Development Board
 - Display panel for animation visualization
 - Sufficient memory for frame buffers and ball data

Section: Usage
==============

 The application automatically animates balls bouncing around the
 screen with alpha blending. Performance metrics including FPS are
 reported for benchmarking purposes.

 NOTE: Debug output is available via ITM when AM_DEBUG_PRINTF is enabled
