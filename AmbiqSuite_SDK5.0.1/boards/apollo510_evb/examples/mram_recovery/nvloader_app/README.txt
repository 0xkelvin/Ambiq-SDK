Name:
=====
 nvloader_app


Description:
============
 Loads preloaded buffer into the MPSI/eMMC memory




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates NV Loader (Non-Volatile
 Loader) functionality for loading preloaded buffer into MSPI/eMMC memory.
 The application showcases memory loading capabilities, MSPI
 flash operations, eMMC memory management, and recovery image handling.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. NV Loader Functionality: Implements NV Loader
    functionality for external memory loading operations

 2. MSPI Flash Support: Provides MSPI flash memory operations
    for reliable external memory management

 3. eMMC Memory Support: Implements eMMC memory management
    for high-capacity external storage operations

 4. Recovery Image Loading: Handles recovery image loading
    for system recovery and restoration capabilities

 5. Memory Verification: Implements memory verification capabilities
    for reliable data loading and validation

Section: Functionality
======================

 The application performs the following operations:
 - Initializes NV Loader functionality for external memory operations
 - Implements MSPI flash memory loading and verification
 - Provides eMMC memory management and partition handling
 - Manages recovery image loading and validation
 - Supports memory verification capabilities
 - Implements NV Loader features

Section: Usage
==============

 1. Compile and download the application to target device
 2. Monitor ITM/SWO output for NV Loader operations and status
 3. Test MSPI flash and eMMC memory loading operations
 4. Verify recovery image loading and validation
 5. Evaluate memory verification and recovery capabilities

Section: Configuration
======================

 - ITM/SWO: Output for debug messages (1MHz)
 - MSPI Flash: MSPI flash memory configuration and operations
 - eMMC Memory: eMMC memory management and partition setup
 - Recovery Image: Recovery image loading and validation settings

Additional Information:
=======================
 Debug messages will be sent over ITM/SWO at 1MHz.
