**********************************************************************************************************
Apollo510 SDK5.0.1 for release on Oct 03, 2025. (GIT SHA release_sdk5p0p1-61912905f0)

This release of the Apollo510 Family SDK includes support for PCM 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 devices.

**********************************************************************************************************

SDK includes a set of examples.  See /boards/*/examples.

IDE/ToolChain Support:
----------------------
AmbiqSuite SDK supports GCC, Keil, and IAR IDEs.
- GCC: 13.2.1
- Keil: ARMCC 6230001 (MDK version 5.42)
- IAR EWARM: 9.60.4 

- Notes about this release:
    * For Segger J-Link debuggers, Apollo510 is supported installing v8.12g or later. 
    * For Keil MDK, Apollo510 is supported by installing the CMSIS Ambiq Pack AmbiqMicro.Apollo_DFP.1.5.0.
    * For IAR, this release was built with and tested on release 9.60.4, which natively supports Apollo510. 
    * By default, Apollo510 projects in this release select the AP510NFA-CBR BGA device.
    * Apollo510 CSP devices are supported by the common AP510NFA-CCR target.

Application considerations when using the HAL:
----------------------------------------------
- AmbiqSuite HAL manages the SoC power consumption to always operate in the most optimal conditions, using a
  number of   internal power states. Transitions from one state to another may require some sequences which
  are not instantaneous. For some of these transitions, HAL implements an internal state machine to let normal
  operations continue to work while the power management transition is happening in the background. To manage
  this internal state machine, HAL uses an internal Timer, as defined by AM_HAL_INTERNAL_TIMER_NUM_A.
  * Option AM_HAL_SPOTMANAGER_USE_TIMER_OR_BLOCKING_DELAY can used to override the default implementation, and instead 
  use blocking delay.
  * Applications are expected to always keep this interrupt enabled and at a high priority to ensure the
  interrupt service latency is kept to a minimum.
  ==> If guaranteeing low latency for this interrupt is not possible, AM_HAL_SPOTMANAGER_TIMER_DOUBLEBOOST should
  be disabled.
- Low Power Initialization Sequence requirements:
  Applications are required to follow the below sequence for initialization:
  am_hal_pwrctrl_low_power_init -> am_hal_pwrctrl_control (AM_HAL_PWRCTRL_CONTROL_SIMOBUCK_INIT) -> am_hal_pwrctrl_temp_update()
- Multi-image transition requirements
  For multi-image situations, application must turn off all peripherals, get back to LP mode (if needed), and call 
  am_hal_pwrctrl_settings_restore() before exiting one application to transition to other

Known Issues:
----------------------
- MRAM Recovery: The use of an external 1.8V USB->UART adapter connected to Apollo510 UART1 is required 
  when using the supplied "uart_recovery_host.py" script with the Apollo510 EVB.
    * Please see the example info0 configuration file "info0_Recovery_UART1.ini" in the 
      \tools\apollo510_scripts\mram_recovery\example_info0_configs directory for setup instructions.
